## Running Marmotte with Docker

Using Docker is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to get Marmotte up and running, irrespective of the platform you're on. Docker encapsulates the application within a container, ensuring it has all the dependencies it needs to run. This means you don't have to worry about installing any additional software or libraries; Docker handles it all for you.

Firstly, if you haven't already, you need to install Docker. Detailed instructions for various platforms can be found on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once Docker is installed, you can deploy Marmotte with just one command:

    docker run -p 8000:8000 \
        --name marmotteio \
        -e APP_NAME=Marmotte.io \
        -e APP_ENV=development \
        -e APP_DEBUG=true \
        -e APP_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000 \
        -e ASSET_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000 \
        -e APP_KEY=base64:RVvW9+2jO9MpuTDyxmIO45Z9t7BY0VWxgDImBNmhFwA= \
        -e DB_CONNECTION=sqlite \
        -e DB_DATABASE=/app/marmotte.sqlite \
        -e DB_FOREIGN_KEYS=true \
        -v marmotteio:/app \
        marmotteio/marmotteio:latest


After the Docker container is running, you can open your favorite browser and head over to:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Default email is `admin@marmotte.io`, and default password is `marmotte.io`.

And that's it! You now have Marmotte running in a Docker container on your machine. This method is especially useful for quick deployments, testing, or even for production scenarios if configured properly.

Note: Do remember to adjust the Docker command as per your requirements, particularly if you need to pass in environment variables, link to databases, or make any other configuration changes.

### Viewing Logs and Managing the Docker Container

Once Marmotte is running within a Docker container, there might be scenarios where you need to view logs in real-time, or you might want to stop the container. Here's how you can do that:

To tail the logs in real-time for your running container, use the following command:

    docker logs -f marmotteio

To stop the Marmotte Docker container:

    docker stop marmotteio

## Running Marmotte with Docker Compose

Docker Compose offers a convenient method to deploy applications like Marmotte, which might consist of several containers that need to interact with each other. The `docker-compose.yml` file in the Marmotte repository defines how these containers should be built and run.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your machine. These tools are essential for running containers and managing multi-container applications.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Clone the Marmotte Repository**: First, clone the Marmotte repository. This repository contains the necessary source code and configuration files, including `docker-compose.yml`. In your terminal, use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL. This step downloads the latest version of the Marmotte code to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Change your current directory in the terminal to the one where you cloned the Marmotte repository. This directory contains the Docker Compose file that you will use in the next steps.

3. **Inspect the Docker Compose File**: Before proceeding, take a moment to open and review the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file is a YAML file that specifies how Docker should run and manage the service containers that make up your Marmotte application. Check for things like the defined services, the ports that are exposed, and any volume mappings. Understanding this file helps you grasp how the application components are orchestrated.

4. **Run Docker Compose**: Execute the following command in the terminal:

    docker-compose up

This command tells Docker Compose to start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. On the first run, Docker will download the necessary images and build the containers, which might take some time. Once the process is complete, your Marmotte application will be running inside these containers.

5. **Access Marmotte**: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the Marmotte application. This URL connects you to the local instance of Marmotte running in your Docker containers.

### Additional Information and Tips
- The `docker-compose up` command may take longer during the first execution due to the downloading and building of Docker images. Subsequent runs will be faster as Docker caches these builds.
- Regularly check the Marmotte repository for updates, especially for changes in the `docker-compose.yml` file, as these might include critical updates or feature additions.
- If you encounter any issues or need to make advanced configurations, refer to the Marmotte documentation or seek community support.

By following these detailed steps, you can successfully run and manage the Marmotte application using Docker Compose.
